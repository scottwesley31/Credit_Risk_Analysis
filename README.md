# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17

## Overview of the Analysis
LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, wants to utilize machine learning to predict credit risk. The management team belives that machine learning can accurately identify good candidates for loans and therefore lower loan default rates overall. Due to the unbalanced nature of the credit risk classification, different training techniques are needed. The purpose of this analysis was to employ several models and algorithms to a credit card dataset and to evaluate the performance of said models. This analysis involves resampling (oversampling, undersampling, and a combinatorial approach) and then later utilizes two different machine learning models (`BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier`). The resampling and machine learning models are all compared in their ability to predict credit risk.

## Results

### Naive Random Oversampling

### Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)

### Cluster Centroid Undersampling

### SMOTE and Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) Combination Sampling

### Balanced Random Forest Classifier

### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
